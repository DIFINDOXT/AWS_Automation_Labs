# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Commitment

This repository contains AWS automation projects designed with security as a top priority. All implementations follow AWS security best practices and include multiple layers of protection.

## 🛡️ Supported Projects

### Current Security Standards

| Project | Security Features | Last Security Review |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **aws-ci-cd-pipeline** | IAM roles, encrypted artifacts, secure builds | Monthly |
| **aws-cost-optimization-ebs-cleaner** | Least privilege Lambda, CloudWatch monitoring | Monthly |
| **aws-eks-starter** | RBAC, network policies, encrypted etcd | Monthly |
| **aws-vpc-secure-alb-asg-bastion-ui** | Multi-layer security groups, bastion host | Monthly |

### Security Implementation Highlights

**Identity & Access Management**
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege principle
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in any configuration
- ✅ Service-specific IAM policies
- ✅ Regular access review and rotation

**Network Security**
- ✅ VPC with properly segmented subnets
- ✅ Security groups with minimal required access
- ✅ Network ACLs for additional layer protection
- ✅ Private subnets for sensitive resources

**Data Protection**
- ✅ Encryption at rest for all storage services
- ✅ Encryption in transit with TLS/SSL
- ✅ Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
- ✅ Regular backup and recovery testing

**Monitoring & Compliance**
- ✅ CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- ✅ AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- ✅ Security Hub for centralized findings
